# Joins

As of Numaflow v0.10, Pipeline Edges can be defined so that multiple Vertices send to 1. This includes:
- UDF Map Vertices
- UDF Reduce Vertices
- Sink Vertices

Please see the following examples:
- [Join on Map Vertex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numaproj/numaflow/main/examples/11-join-on-map.yaml)
- [Join on Reduce Vertex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numaproj/numaflow/main/examples/11-join-on-reduce.yaml)
- [Join on Sink Vertex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numaproj/numaflow/main/examples/11-join-on-sink.yaml)
